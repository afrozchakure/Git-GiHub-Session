### Repository with Step-by-Step instructions for working with Git and Github

#### After everything is set, the first thing we have to do is to configure git with our name and email:
``git config --global user.name [username]``  
``git config --global user.email [email-id]``   
``cd desktop``   
``mkdir mygitrepo``  
``cd mygitrepo``  

#### Now weâ€™re ready to initialize a brand new git repository.
``git init``

#### We can check for the current status of the git repository by using
``git status``

#### We can check if there is any file in the directory by
``ls``

#### Git directory is hidden to see it we use
``ls -a``

#### To go to previous directory we use 
``cd ..``

#### Create and commit a new file
``touch hello.txt``

#### To "register" the file for committing we need to add it to git using
``git add hello.txt``

#### Checking for the status now indicates that the file is ready to be committed:
``git status``

#### We can now commit it to the repository
``git commit -m "Add my first file"``

#### To see recent changes/commit we use 
``git log``

#### This would add Hello, world! to hello.txt
``echo Hello, world! > hello.txt``

#### A patch-style view of the difference between the currently edited and committed files
``git diff``

#### The full list of changes since the beginning of time:
``git log``  
``git log --since=yesterday``  
``git log --since=2weeks``  

#### To discover why, when and by whom a certain line was added
``git blame hello.txt``

#### To abort current uncommitted changes and restore the working copy to the last committed state:
#### Discards all of currently uncommitted (unstaged or staged) changes:
``git reset --hard``

#### To remove a file from staging area we use
``git reset HEAD [~filename~]``

#### To view the statistics and facts about the last commit:
``git show``

#### A remote called origin is automatically created if we cloned a remote repository. The full address of that remote can be viewed with:
``git remote -v``

#### To add origin and check wether remote is added or not
``git remote add origin [repo-link]
git remote``

#### To put changes from local repo in the remote repo:
``git push origin master``

#### From remote repo to get most recent changes : 
``git pull``
